# 🚀 Create a React-Tailwind Project

This repository provides a few convenient scripts to create a new React project using Vite and configure it with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. Choose the version that suits your
preferences:

* NPX usage
* Node.js Version (create-tailwind-react.js).

## Usage

Before running any of the scripts or even the npm version, make sure you have node.js installed. If you haven't installed node yet, run `brew install node` in your terminal( Mac). For other systems please use built in package managers or find installers for your system type located at nodejs.org .

### 📦 NPX usage

In a terminal run the following:

```
npx create-tailwind-react <your-project-name>
```



### Node.js Version

1. Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `create-tailwind-react.js` file is located.
3. Run `node create-tailwind-react.js <your_project_name>` to create a new React project with Vite, install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies, and update the project configuration files.

All versions will create a new React project with Vite, install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies, and update the project configuration files.

After running the script, start using Tailwind's utility classes to style your content! 🎨

💡 Don't forget to check the generated `tailwind.config.js` and `src/index.scss` files.
